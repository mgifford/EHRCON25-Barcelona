# OSS Europe Amsterdam Food Guide

Headed to Amsterdam for [Open Source Summit Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/)?  
Here’s a community-curated list of food and drink spots near the RAI and across the city. These are places I’ve tried and enjoyed on past trips, plus a few that others have recommended.  

If you’ve got a favorite café, bar, or restaurant to add, please contribute! The goal is to make it easier for folks in the open source community to find good eats while in town.

## Top Picks

If you only have time for a few meals, here are some of my personal favorites:  

- [D’Vijff Vlieghen](places/d-vijff-vlieghen.md) — A classic Amsterdam dining spot with history and character.  
- [De Hapjeshoek](places/de-hapjeshoek.md) — Surinamese street food, quick and flavorful.  
- [Pancake House Upstairs](places/pancake-house-upstairs.md) — Tiny, quirky, and some of the best pancakes in the city.

## How it works
- Each place has its own Markdown file in `/places` with details (address, neighborhood, why it’s good, tips).  
- The full list is also in `/data/places.csv` for quick reference.  
- Contributions are welcome — see [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute).

## Note on travel times
Travel times from the RAI are ballpark and can change with routes or time of day.  
Check day-of in Google Maps or [9292](https://9292.nl/en) for the most accurate directions.
